Get your products in front of Pinterest users searching for ideas and things to buy. Connect your WooCommerce store to make your entire catalog browsable.

== Description ==

Pinterest gives people their next great idea. Part collection, part marketplace, it’s a one-stop shop for millions of pinners to source inspiration, new products and new possibilities. It’s like a visual search engine, guiding people to ideas, inspiration and products that are just right for them.

With the Pinterest for WooCommerce extension, you can put your products in front of Pinterest users who are already looking for ideas and things to buy. Connect your WooCommerce store to your *[Pinterest business account](https://business.pinterest.com/)* directly in the WooCommerce app. Your entire catalog will become browsable on Pinterest in just a few clicks.

= Open-minded and undecided =

People on Pinterest are eager for new ideas, which means they want to hear from you. In fact, 97% of top Pinterest searches are unbranded. Content from brands doesn’t interrupt on Pinterest—it inspires. Shopping features are built into both the organic Pinner experience, and our ad solutions.

We'll also automatically set up your Pinterest tag, and a shop tab on your Pinterest profile.
